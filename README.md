Just a handful of useful or utility scripts


## file_monitor.sh
 Used to watch a directory every minute for newly created files. Every newly created file is tar'd the scp to a remote directory ( other file transfer methods can be used instead if needed ). This is done by utilizing crontab
 Just meant as a way for devs to drop files into a directory and have them moved to a remote repository/directory for tracking purposes.
